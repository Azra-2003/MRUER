      <p>Our story began in 1999. Back then, we started off as a non-profit organisation founded by Chief Operations Officer Faizal Ally and CEO Dilnaaz Ally, yearning to make a difference in the heart of a crime-ridden South Africa. Operating mainly in Johannesburg, we started to assist with medical, private security, and natural disaster emergencies. Our team rapidly grew to over 50 trained and registered volunteers over a short period of time who shared our organisation’s vision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, with our 21 years of experience and as a SASETTA (Safety and Security Sector Education and Training Authority) and PSiRA (Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority) registered security business with a separate volunteer charitable division in affiliation to the BAC E2 (business against crime) project working with the South African Police Service, we are fortunate to connect not only with our local South African companies but we have expanded to global companies as well, to assist them in meeting their security demands via our wide range of tailored comprehensive security services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our mission: to mitigate security risks nationally and internationally utilising our knowledge and expertise. We’ve always believed in delivering beyond expectations. It's our goal for all of our security services to offer the highest standards of quality, using ethical and analytical strategic planning and execution. We source our solutions from as far away as Dublin to Washington to Kuala Lumpur bringing an effective solution to each MRU ER security assignment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From setting up and managing security Control Monitoring Centres, evacuating executives from violent public protest disruptions, corporate and private security consultancy, asset satellite tracking, undercover security, risk assessment and security site management services, high-risk tactical assignments, and private security training, each of our customers are treated as family with care and dedication, linking an effective solution to each of their safety and security demands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are also involved in the development and enhancement of home and business security automation products and services and we are not limited to any specific type of security service or security product sales. Faizal Ally (COO) has been trained locally and abroad in security intelligence, hostage negotiations, DNA and crime scene awareness as well as obtaining qualifications in NQF level 5 as a Trainer and Assessor Practitioner, Quality ISO 9000 and CQC (Close Quarter Combat) and he thrives in ensuring that all MRU ER security personnel are upskilled and thoroughly trained and assessed before been deployed to various assigned sites as well as personally undertaking security assignments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dilnaaz Ally (CEO) has tactical training and competencies in a variety of firearms such as shotgun, rifle, carbine, and handgun and undertakes private security assignments from time to time. Dilnaaz oversees our corporate decisions as well as analyses, plans, and strategizes specific security tasks. At MRU ER, we have always believed in the importance of being a fundamental service provider and building long-lasting supportive relationships with our clients.</p>
